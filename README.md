## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)  
- npm  
- Hardhat CLI

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <https://github.com/toosolid2003/rental>
cd rental

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts locally (adjust parameters if needed)
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/RentlScoreModule.ts --network localhost

# Start frontend dev server
npm run dev
```

The contract's owner address is the first available address generated by Hardhat Node. Import it into your wallet to be interact with the UI - there is strict access control on the contract: only the renter and the landlord can see the payments and the rental score.
